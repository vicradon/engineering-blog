This is my very first blog post on this blog. The purpose of this blog is to help me document all I learn from my Mechanical Engineering Internship. Here are a few things I have planned out:

1. Write about Arduino, RaspberryPI and systems programming.
2. Write about 3D modelling, tips and tricks and the likes.
